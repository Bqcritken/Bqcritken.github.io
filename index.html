<p class="break-1"> Hello and welcome to my streamer page. I stream at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bqcritken">https://www.twitch.tv/bqcritken</a>. Here you'll find information about myself and the stream. First of all, my name is Bqcritken. The name Bqcritken comes from my original druid's name. It's mean Barbeque Critical Chicken, he was a balance druid. I'm an Assistant Manager with Wal-Mart looking for a way out of retail. I'm also a Computer Science student with Wilmington University. I'm looking to be doing streaming only part-time but if it goes well I'll make it full time. </p>

<p> During this stream you can expect a fun atmosphere. I do ask you keep all conversation and language usage PG. Streams at the moment will vary until I find my rhythm on how often I want to stream.
